  There can be an unlimited amount of folders.

5. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
5. Install the required packages by running `npm install`.
6. Add the bot to your server using [this link](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html).

8. Enjoy!

## Commands
- `![foldername]` - attaches a random image from the folder in the directory of index.js.
- `![foldername] [int]` - attaches a specific image from the folder specified by config.json

Edit I made fixed major instability by breaking another feature oops but oh well atleast it doesn't crash as much.
